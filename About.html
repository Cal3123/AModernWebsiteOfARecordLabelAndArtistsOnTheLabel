            <p>The Chainsmokers are a pop act consisting of two DJs named Drew Taggart (born December 31, 1989) and Alex Pall (born May 16, 1985). 
                They first hit the charts with the novelty song "#Selfie."</p>
            <p>Two years later, in 2016, they soared to the top of the charts with "Closer," one of the biggest pop hit singles of all time. 
                The true sound of the Chainsmokers wasn't evident until their top 10 smash "Roses." The music of the Chainsmokers crosses 
                boundaries pulling in elements of pop and hip hop making it ultra-catchy with an infectious dance beat.
                Their debut EP, Bouquet, was released in October 2015 and featured the single "Roses", which reached the top 10 on the US 
                Billboard Hot 100. "Don't Let Me Down", featuring American singer Daya, became their first top-five single on the Billboard chart 
                and won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording at the 59th awards ceremony. Their single "Closer", featuring American singer-songwriter 
                Halsey, became their first number-one single on the Billboard chart.
